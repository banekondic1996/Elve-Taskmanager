This is just vibe coded system monitor "taskmanager" app that i made for personal usage. <br>
Why?<br>
Well cause KDE plasma System Monitor idle uses like 4-5% cpu, Gnome System monitor is almost same from 2010 and now,
so i made this.<br> I know web app isn't best for cpu usage, but this is still better then KDE System Monitor, even if it uses QT. <br> It's just testing version that will be used in my linux desktop enviroment I'm making. And it will be optimized in future 
<br>Personaly i use some 3d party system monitor on my linux, but even it uses a lot of cpu that i use just terminal and top command...
End app won't use electron. <br> <br>
Main difference compared to others:<br>
-It will have option to schedule task using crontab <br>
-Block internet access per app <br>
-Gpu usage showed compared to Gnome one and KDE one <br>
-Can list files opend by process<br><br>

This version needs some fixing, it's not final. Not everything is added still.<br>
Logo was as idea of heart pulse, bright red to add seriousness and cpu logo to resemple electronics. <br> 
Like a cpu on cardiac monitor, really like it.<br>
It's just for linux <br> <br>
