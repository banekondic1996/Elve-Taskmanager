**Demonstration video** - <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D7g_veuOgQ'>Link</a> <br> <br>
This is just vibe coded system monitor "taskmanager" app that i made for personal usage. <br>

**Why i made this?**<br>
Well cause KDE plasma System Monitor idle uses like 4-5% cpu, Gnome System monitor is almost same from 2010 and now,
so i made this.<br> I know web app isn't best for cpu usage, but this is still better then KDE System Monitor, even if it uses QT. <br> It's just testing version that will be used in my linux desktop enviroment I'm making. And it will be optimized in future 
<br>Personaly i use some 3d party system monitor on my linux, but even it uses a lot of cpu that i use just terminal and top command...<br>
End app won't use electron. <br>
To use all functions you have to start app as root (the unpacked version)
<br> <br>
**Main difference compared to others:**<br>
-It will have option to schedule task using crontab <br>
-See network connections <br>
-Control systemd services <br>
-View system logs<br>
-Block internet access per app <br>
-Gpu usage showed compared to Gnome one and KDE one <br>
-Can list files opend by process<br>
-Add startup apps<br>

**To fix:**<br>
-CPU and Network limiting not tested, might not be working <br>
-GPU usage per process<br>
-Make it more efficent by writing own CLI app that will return data<br>
-Add option to choose user when adding crontab <br>
-View graphs independently with more information (CPU, GPU, Network, Disk, RAM) <br>
<br>

This version needs some fixing, it's not final. Not everything is added still.<br>
Logo was as idea of heart pulse, bright red to add seriousness and cpu logo to resemple electronics. <br> 
Like a cpu on cardiac monitor, really like it.<br>
It's just for linux <br> <br>
